Glory to God for the weird things,
The uncertain stuff that life brings.
The peculiar animals that capture our eye,
In these interesting moments, our attention reaches an all time high.

Like the hairy capybara and the red-eyed frog,
And the white Borzoi thats considered a dog,
These lovely creatures brightens our day,
Our mind has been blown, in every possible way

In nature's peculiarity, we want to know more.
So like Dora, let's explore,
For in these animals, we understand their grace,
A reminder that life is a fascinating place.
