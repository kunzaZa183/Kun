Ode to sleep

What is the greatest thing?
A man once asked, a million people
They all gave a variety of answers
The most popular one is fathomably simple

A thing so common that everybody does
A thing tired students adore
A thing that one could never have enough
That thing is sleep, that we've all been waiting for

Passing time in class with no clocks
Keeping us awake 
In a tiring school day with 5 blocks
Sleep is the only meaningful break

Awake I am, writing this ode
But it is time to count some sheep
I hope to you I showed,
That maybe you should sleep
